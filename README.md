Open the brower at http://127.0.0.1:2425/, then you can talk with Tom. But he is very foolish now: he just know three words.
- 'Tom' It's his name.
- 'joke' He can tell you a joke, but he only know five jokes.
- 'time' He can tell you the time.

## Hope
If you want to let him more intelligent, you need let him study more.
